                                         The AXMC sniper rifle, known for its modularity and precision, consists of several key components. The 'receiver' serves as the main framework, housing the trigger mechanism and bolt assembly. The 'barrel' is engineered for accuracy and can be easily replaced to accommodate different calibers. The 'stock' is adjustable, providing comfort and stability for the shooter, while the 'pistol grip' enhances control. The 'scope mount' allows for the attachment of high-quality optics for precise targeting. The 'magazine' feeds ammunition into the chamber, ensuring reliable cycling. Additionally, the 'bipod' provides a stable shooting platform, making the AXMC an effective choice for long-range engagements. Together, these parts contribute to the rifle's reputation for performance and versatility.
