                                         The AK-47, a widely recognized assault rifle, is composed of several key parts that work together to ensure its reliability and functionality. The 'receiver' serves as the main body, housing the trigger mechanism and connecting various components. The 'barrel' is the long tube through which bullets are fired, providing accuracy and range. At the rear, the 'stock' offers stability for aiming and firing, while the 'pistol grip' allows for better control. The 'gas system' utilizes gas from fired cartridges to cycle the action and chamber the next round. The 'bolt carrier group', which includes the bolt and firing pin, is responsible for firing and ejecting spent cartridges. The 'magazine' holds the ammunition and feeds it into the chamber, and the 'front and rear sights' aid in aligning the rifle for accurate shooting. Together, these parts contribute to the AK-47's reputation as a durable and effective firearm.
